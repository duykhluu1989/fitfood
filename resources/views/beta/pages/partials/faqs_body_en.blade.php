                <p>- Fitfood follows the new Healthy Eating Plate which was created by Harvard Health Publications and nutrition experts at Harvard.</p>
                <p>- We aims to cater fitness and healthy lifestyle purpose. All meals was designed with the most suitable portion of vitamin, protein and nutrition. We select some of the best foods in the world including brocolli, tomato, carrot, spinach or chicken breast.</p>
                <p>- Lean meat was prepared and cooked fresh daily without adding MSG. All meals are ensured to have low sugar content. Most of the meals was served boneless and we try our best to elimitate all the clean up hassle after eating since we know most of you are working in the office.</p>
                <p>- We dont include soup in our package since it is usually spilled out during transporation. Please supplement by 2 litre of water per day which would help you lose belly fat, detox and at the same time get a healthier lifestyle. You can add 1 small glass of fruit juice to your daily diet to boost up your metabolism.</p>
                <p>- Most meals come with sauces (we add meat stock together with low calories sugar to flavour up the sauce), please adjust your favourite taste by putting the suitable amount of sauce to the meal.</p>
